# Docker Overview

## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient environments that include everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.

## Why Use Docker?

- **Lightweight**: Docker containers share the host operating system's kernel, making them more lightweight than virtual machines
- **Portability**: Containers can run consistently across different environments
- **Efficiency**: Faster startup times and lower resource consumption compared to VMs
- **Isolation**: Applications run in isolated environments without interfering with each other
- **Consistency**: Eliminates the "it works on my machine" problem by packaging the application with all its dependencies
- **Scalability**: Easy to scale applications horizontally by spinning up additional containers

## Docker vs. Virtual Machines

| Feature            | Docker                         | Virtual Machines                |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Operating System   | Shares host OS kernel         | Requires full OS installation   |
| Resource Usage     | Lightweight (MBs)              | Heavyweight (GBs)                |
| Boot Time          | Seconds                        | Minutes                          |
| Isolation Level    | Process-level isolation       | Hardware-level isolation        |
| Performance        | Near-native performance       | Some overhead                    |
| Portability        | Highly portable across Linux distributions | Less portable between different hypervisors |

## Key Benefits

- **Time-saving**: Standardizes development, testing, and production environments
- **Easy deployment**: Ship containers with all dependencies included
- **Works across environments**: Consistent behavior from development to production
- **Simple to use with Linux**: Runs natively on Linux systems (Ubuntu, CentOS, Arch Linux, etc.)
- **Resource efficient**: Uses significantly fewer resources than traditional virtualization

## Use Cases

- Microservices architecture
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Development environments
- Application isolation
- Legacy application packaging
- Hybrid cloud deployments
